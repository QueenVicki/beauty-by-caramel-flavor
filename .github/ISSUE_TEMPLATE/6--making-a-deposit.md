As a customer I can make a payment for the booked service so that my appointment is confirmed.

- The payment gateway is secure and supports multiple payment options (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

- The customer can review the total cost, including any taxes or fees, before making the payment and receives a payment receipt and booking confirmation immediately after the payment is processed.

- The customer will loose their deposit if they cancel or change their appointment day less than 24 hours before the appointment
