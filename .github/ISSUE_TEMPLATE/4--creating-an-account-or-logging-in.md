As a customer I can create an account or log in to an existing one so that I can save my booking details and manage my appointments.

- The customer is prompted to create an account or log in before finalizing the booking.

- The account creation process is user-friendly, requiring only essential information (name, email, and password).

- Logged-in customers can view and manage their past and upcoming bookings from their account dashboard.
